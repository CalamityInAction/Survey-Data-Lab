# Survey-Data-Lab

I learned a lot about selecting specific columns of values in datasets and analyzing their data, wiht the groupby functions and plotting to display clear and accurate data. I also gained knowledge and confidence with this project (which I didn't have before, causing the delay). I learned to utilize array splicing and just get used to jupyter notebook (so "df.head()" alone as an example prints a formatted table).
